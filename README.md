I am using SVGs to generate random NFT ImageURIs and Metadata 100% on-chain. In combination with Chainlink VRF to create randomness and true scarcity. I used Hardhat, Javascript, and Solidity. These customized smart contracts were deployed to the Polygon chain, so you can see exactly how i did this!
I am using the [Polygon NFTs](https://polygon.io/nft) contract to create the NFTs.
